public class Practice {
//INSTRUCTIONS
	//TOPIC: Color
	//Setup: need privates for each constructor?/. make a public that has "Name"(String l,Boolean o, Char 2, idk one of those).
	//this."thing"="thinge"... maybe put in boolean (true or false), you know things that will make an actual thing happen
	//make a runner in the same class (put a main out of the parenthesis of the constructor. make sure to call the variables for it to work
	//1. make constructor
		//make the public including (string, boolean, etc. stuff like that)
	//2. runner (main)
	//3. in main method, do the Practice (practice because that is the class name, can change), (String, boolean, etc. thing)
	//4. call the things
 //btw i moved the outliner (outlier??) and task down for more space
